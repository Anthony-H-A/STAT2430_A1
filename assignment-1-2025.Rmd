Instructions

For assignment 1, complete the following tasks

* Add your name and today's date up at the top of this file
* Familiarize yourself with the `penguins` dataset in the next section.
* Draw a plot and refine it twice using the methods from Lesson 5 Making your first plot as directed below
* Before knitting this file, make sure for each figure to:
-describe the figure you plan to show, 
-show your R code for the figure
-show the output of your R code
-say a sentence or 2 about each figure (interpretation)

Your report should

## Look at the data

Here is a condensed overview of the `penguins` data

```{r}
str(penguins)
```
and an overview of the `penguins_raw` supplementary data.

```{r}
str(penguins_raw)
```

We will use the penguins dataset.

## New visualization

### Step 1 (3 pts)

<!--

q1.1

Write a R code (1 line) that print the names of the columns of the penguins dataset. [0.5 pts]

-->


```{r}
names(penguins)
```


<!--

q1.2

Create a scatterplot of bill length (on the x axis) and bill depth (on the y axis).  Make the simplest plot you can, using just `ggplot`, `aes` and `geom_point`. [1.5 pts]

-->



```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(y=bill_depth_mm, x=bill_length_mm)) + geom_point()
```


<!--
q1.3

Write 1 sentence that describes what you see (or do not see)  in your plot [1 pt]
-->

I see a scatter plot with a grey background, white grid lines, and many black dots: the y axis reads "bill_depth_mm" and seems to range approximately between 12.5 and 22, while the x axis reads "bill_length_mm" and seems to range approximately between 33 and 61 (there is also an error message stating that two rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range were removed, but this seems to be a common occurrence when using the palmerpenguins data set).

### Step 2 (2 pts)

<!--
q2.1

Refine your previous plot, adding colour or shape to indicate the species. Just do the minimal change. (2 pts)
-->


```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(y=bill_depth_mm, x=bill_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(colour=species))
```


<!--

q2.2

The addition of distinguishing species by colour on the plot informs us clearly that bill depth and bill length are correlated with species, with there being three obvious groupings; one for each species.
-->


### Step 3 (2 pts)

<!--

q3.1

Refine your plot by adding informative and readable axis labels and a brief title for the plot.
-->


```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(y=bill_depth_mm, x=bill_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(colour=species)) + labs(title="Palmer Archipelago Penguins' Bill Measurements", x="Bill Length", y="Bill Depth") + theme(text = element_text(size=13))
```

This scatter plot shows the relationship between bill depth and length in Anarctic Penguins by species. The colour allows us to distinguish between species on the scatter plot, and it has been formatted with a neat title as well as axes labels of an appropriate font size.

## Another comparison 

<!--

q4 (2 pts)

Make any additional plot of your choice to illustrate another aspect of the comparison of penguins morphologies across species 
-->


```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(y=flipper_length_mm, x=body_mass_g)) + geom_point(aes(colour=species)) + labs(title="Palmer Penguins' Flipper Length & Body Mass", x="Body Mass", y="Flipper Length") + theme(text = element_text(size=13))
```

This scatter plot demonstrates that flipper length and total body mass have a positive correlation among the three species of penguins in the Palmer Archipelago. Furthermore, thanks to the coloration of the dots according to species, we can see that Gentoo penguins have larger flippers and weigh more than the Adelie and Chinstrap penguins to a significant degree.

<!--

q5 Knit and submit Rmd+pdf (1 pt)

Knit your work to pdf (click "knit" in the menu just at the top of the editing window).

If knitting does not work, spot the line with an error, fix the error in your Rmd file, then reknit. Iterate this procedure until until there are no errors and knitting finishes.

If knitting to pdf does not work, knit to html, load the html in your web browser and use the print function of your browser to print your html file 'as pdf'.

Once done, upload two files, (one after the other): your Rmd file and the knitted pdf.

DO NOT FORGET TO REPLACE your name and banner id in the header of this file, but do NOT mess up the header!

Pushing your report to github [Unmarked but do it!]

Stage, commit and push your final .Rmd and your .html file to your GitHub repository (as done in W2 task number 3- see instructions on Brightspace>Week 2).
